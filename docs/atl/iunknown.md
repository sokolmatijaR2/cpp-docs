# IUnknown

[IUnknown](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) is the base interface of every other COM interface.  This interface defines three methods: [QueryInterface](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q_)), [AddRef](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-addref), and [Release](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release). [QueryInterface](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q_)) allows an interface user to ask the object for a pointer to another of its interfaces. [AddRef](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-addref) and [Release](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release) implement reference counting on the interface.
