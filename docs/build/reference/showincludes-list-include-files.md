# /showIncludes (List Include Files)

Causes the compiler to output a list of the include files. Nested include files are also displayed (files that are included from the files that you include).

## Syntax

```
/showIncludes
```

## Remarks

When an include file is encountered during compilation, a message is output, for example:

```
Note: including file: d:\MyDir\include\stdio.h
```

Nested include files are indicated by an indentation, one space for each level of nesting, for example:

```
Note: including file: d:\temp\1.h
Note: including file:  d:\temp\2.h
```

In this case, `2.h` was included from within `1.h`, hence the indentation.

The **/showIncludes** option emits to `stderr`, not `stdout`.
